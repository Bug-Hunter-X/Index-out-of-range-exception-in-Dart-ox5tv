# Dart Index out of Range Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: an index out of range exception. The bug occurs when trying to access an element in a list using an index that is greater than or equal to the list's length.  The solution demonstrates how to prevent this error using checks to ensure the index is valid before accessing the element.
